# About

Hello this is my i3 config.

The i3 config is an edit of https://github.com/alorgill/dotfiles, to make it fit more of my schemes and usage of i3.

This config was made for an X220 laptop, using arch.

# Dependancies
i3-gaps   
i3lock-fancy-git (pretty locking)   
nitrogen (for wallpaper)   
rofi   
terminator (or whichever terminal you prefer)   
conky   
tamsyn-font   


Feel free to modify and use this as you please, should work with other laptops as well, but was mostly designed for an X220.   
Thank you!

# Installation

Copy contents of i3 into ~/.config/i3/ .   

Copy contents of Terminator into ~/.config/terminator/ .   
If no config exists, right click terminator, click preferences, and just change one thing. Terminator will then generate a config.   

Move colors-rofi-dark.rasi to wherever you like.   

in ~/.config/rofi/config write:   

> rofi.theme: ~/.cache/wal/colors-rofi-dark.rasi
