# About

Hello this is my i3 config.

The i3 config is an edit of https://github.com/alorgill/dotfiles, to make it fit more of my schemes and usage of i3.

This config was made for an X220 laptop, using arch.

Feel free to modify and use this as you please, should work with other laptops as well, but was mostly designed for an X220.   
Thank you!
